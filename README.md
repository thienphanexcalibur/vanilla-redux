## Redux for Mithril

I worked with Mithril for a while then make this one as a default state management in some production projects.

Checkout the live example: https://codesandbox.io/s/vanilla-redux-mithril-1n6cx

See `store.js` for details.

* Provide Redux-ish features like: `subscribe`, `connect`, `dispatch` actions

* Middleware: Logger built-in for tracking state mutations and actions dispatching.

### Contritbutions are welcome.
