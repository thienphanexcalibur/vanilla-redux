## Redux for MithrilJS

I've worked with [MithrilJS](https://mithril.js.org/) for a while then make this one as a default state management in some production projects.

Checkout the live example: https://codesandbox.io/s/vanilla-redux-mithril-1n6cx

See `store.js` for more details.

* Provide Redux-ish features like: `subscribe`, `connect`, `dispatch` actions

* Middlewares: Logger built-in for tracking state mutations and actions dispatching.

### Contributions are welcomed.
